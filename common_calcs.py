GET_TORQUE - Calculate double cage motor torque and stator current (without core loss component)
 
Usage: get_torque (slip,type,x)

Where slip is the motor slip (pu)

           x = [Rs Xs Xm Rr1 Xr1 Rr2 Xr2]
            Rs = stator resistance

            Rr2 = outer cage resistance
            Xr2 = outer cage reactance       
             
Returns: motor torque (pu) as a real number and stator current (as a
complex number and without core loss component)
